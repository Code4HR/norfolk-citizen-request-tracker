Citizen Request Track iOS app description
The free, simple and easy to use Citizen Request Tracker™ app gives small to medium-sized cities and counties across
North America – and their residents and business owners - the same citizen-power to report civic issues, and the
integrated municipal tracking capabilities, that was previously available only in large metropolitan areas.

NOTE
===
All mobile and facebook app traffic is actually aggregated and categorized by the norfolk cares department. The apps do not have the mechanic to do that, on the website you can fill out by form so it DOES support categories.
